The year is 2167\. The Earth is overpopulated, ruled by a vast corporate entity known as the World Order. Lost within the crush of the seething populace, Simon Shadow narrowly survives a coworker's explosive suicide, leading him to a fateful decision---abandon Earth to start a new life on a distant world. The colonies, however, are marred by the World Order's savage mix of spirituality and commerce; it doesn't take long for Simon to find himself caught in the middle of an inescapable religious war. Struggling to adapt to the bureaucratic rigors of the colony, Simon gathers a few unlikely allies; but no one can prepare him for the side-effect of his exposure to the powerful drug Tigris: an amplified awareness of apocalyptic spider-like entities lurking at the threshold of human consciousness. The parabolic odyssey that unfolds is rife with danger. From the depths of an alien desert to the very gates of human perception---and beyond---Simon Shadow must find a way out!
