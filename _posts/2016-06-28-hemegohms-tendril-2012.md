Hemegohm's Tendril (2012)

Illustrated by the author, this triptych of science fiction stories is set within the dystopian universe of the novel _The Rise and Fall of Shimmerism_. "The Profits of Apocalypse" takes place on New Year's Eve, in the year 2199, approximately 33 years after the events of the novel. The tale begins at the League of Faiths Pavilion on the planet Reetar, where one of the novel's pervasively present, yet never encountered characters, Pad Q. Glibbert, is addressing his constituents. In the crowd sits an elderly Meinolf Gloomdred, prurient as always, and still enraged about Simon Shadow having slipped from his vengeful grasp so many years prior. "The Centers of Old Empires" begins in the year 2167, mere moments after the novel ends. Simon Shadow has been abandoned in an escape pod, cruelly dumped in a distant, unknown solar system by the United Galactic Marine Corps. As the hours pass, Simon slowly realizes his survival is tied to an ominous set of choices. "The Gulf of the Architect" takes place in the year 2200, three months after the events of "The Profits of Apocalypse." Armboris Thorn, a disillusioned Zealtor of the World Order on the planet Tigris IV, agrees to take on a mysterious new client---a man with a strangely familiar name, a missing past, and an enticing proposal.
