  Hemegohm's Tendril (2012) - Illustrated by the author, this triptych of
  science fiction stories is set within the dystopian universe of the novel The
  Rise and Fall of Shimmerism. "The Profits of Apocalypse" takes place on New
  Year’s Eve, in the year 2199, approximately 33 years after the events of the
  novel. The tale begins at the League of Faiths Pavilion on the planet Reetar,
  where one of the novel's pervasively present, yet never encountered
  characters, Pad Q. Glibbert, is addressing his constituents. In the crowd sits
  an elderly Meinolf Gloomdred, prurient as always, and still enraged about
  Simon Shadow having slipped from his vengeful grasp so many years prior. "The
  Centers of Old Empires" begins in the year 2167, mere moments after the novel
  ends. Simon Shadow has been abandoned in an escape pod, cruelly dumped in a
  distant, unknown solar system by the United Galactic Marine Corps. As the
  hours pass, Simon slowly realizes his survival is tied to an ominous set of
  choices. "The Gulf of the Architect" takes place in the year 2200, three
  months after the events of "The Profits of Apocalypse." Armboris Thorn, a
  disillusioned Zealtor of the World Order on the planet Tigris IV, agrees to
  take on a mysterious new client—a man with a strangely familiar name, a
  missing past, and an enticing proposal.
